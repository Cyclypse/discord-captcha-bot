<p>Kensho is a Discord bot to keep your server safe!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spambots and targeted raids using automated user accounts are real<br>
issues for some servers. Just in the past few months, I’ve seen<br>
servers with more than 10,000 users get raided using these methods.<br>
This bot helps irradicate the fear of your server getting autonomously<br>
attacked.</p>

<p>Having trouble setting up the bot yourself? Join <strong><a href="https://discord.gg/j9fCaF7">https://discord.gg/j9fCaF7</a></strong> for assistance.<br>
If you don’t want to host it yourself, you may use <a href="https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=565019416803147776&amp;permissions=8&amp;scope=bot"><strong>this invite</strong></a> link; 24/7 hosted instance of Kensho!<br>
If you’d like to see the bot in action for yourself, join <strong><a href="https://discord.gg/j9fCaF7">https://discord.gg/j9fCaF7</a></strong>!</p>
<p>You may view commands by running .!commands, and find the guide at the wiki in this repository.<br>
I assume you know how to manage a Discord bot, you may join the support server for help.</p>
<p>The setup is super simple and easy, simply run .!checklist, and you may change values using .!config<br>
What if the user has disabled DMs? The bot will reply with this message:<br>
